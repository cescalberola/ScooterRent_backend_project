# 🛴 Scooter Rent (E-commerce)

Welcome to my first backend project for the Online Store! In this project, I combine my knowledge of Node.js, Express, and MySQL/Sequelize to develop a RESTful API for managing an online store. 🚀

## 📝 Description

🛴 The eCommerce project I've developed focuses on a scooter rental store, leveraging the power of MySQL and Sequelize as the database and ORM, respectively. The system comprises several key entities, enabling efficient store management and offering scalability for future expansions.

🏪 **Store Table**: This table stores information about scooter rental stores. Each store is associated with multiple scooters available for rent.

🛴 **Scooters Table**: In this table, details of the scooters available for rent are recorded. It is related in a one-to-many relationship with the Store table, meaning one store can have multiple scooters for rent.

👥 **Customers Table**: Customer data using the scooter rental service is registered here.

📈 **Intermediate CustomerScooter Table**: This table plays a crucial role as it establishes a many-to-many relationship between customers and scooters. Each entry in this table indicates which customer has rented which scooter at a given time 🕒.

🏪 The database architecture allows the scooter rental store to maintain a detailed record of its stores, available scooters, and customers. Furthermore, the many-to-many relationship between scooters and customers through the intermediate table provides flexibility to handle multiple rentals by a customer and the ability to track the scooters in use 📈.

📈🌟 The project's scalability is ensured, as new stores and services can be added in the future seamlessly, maintaining data integrity and efficient management. This provides a solid foundation for the continuous growth of the scooter rental store and adaptation to changing market needs.

📊 Midway through the project, we discovered the Trello tool for project workflow, and it has proven to be invaluable in organizing my tasks in the project.

Once the project's requirements have been analyzed, the student will need to develop a RESTful API capable of:

- 🔐 User registration using Bcrypt.
- 🚪 User login with tokens and middleware.
- ✍️ Creating a CRUD.
- ↔️ Establishing at least one "Many to Many" and one "One to Many" relationship.
- 🌱 Using seeders to populate the initial database.

### 📌 Essential Project Requirements

Make sure the README is excellent. 😉✨

## 💻 Technologies Used

For the development of this API, we will be using the following technologies:

- Node.js
- Express
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- Jwt
- Postman

The project will be hosted in a public GitHub repository, and we will appreciate the presence of multiple branches and commits with clear and readable commit messages to analyze the project's evolution. It is essential for the repository to include a comprehensive README.
